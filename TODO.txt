Get rid of extra newline text wrap. done

Backticks around functions or anything else which you can type at the Console or Terminal. done

Add blank lines around things like ###, code chunks and so on. need to look through again

No "Next, we .." done

Our goal is to finish the other 4 tutorials in this collection.

Let's do r4ds-2 next. Need to find some data you like, then create speadhseets versions of that data, then put those xls files in extdata, editing README.txt as you see fit. Think about how you want to structure the spreadsheets, given what you want students to learn. Perhaps the only concrete example is that it may be nice to use more than one sheet in the book. Then those spreadsheets serve as the basis of the two or three sections.

Where data? Find some plots you think are cool which have the data available.

Think ahead about r4ds-4. Note that it explores date-times, missing, joins. 




Find some data sources. 

    * Begin by re-reading these three data source chapters: spreadsheets, (duck) databases, and arrow. Maybe we really just start with looking for data that we like, data that we know makes a cool plot.

    * Go looking for cool examples these data sources, stuff that would be fun to play with and make a cool plot.

# Introductions

This package will hold all of our new breed AI tutorials.


## Plan for R4DS

We will have 5 one hour tutorials which cover the material in R4DS. It is tricky to figure out the best way to organize this since so many of the later tutorials cover stand-alone topics like spreadsheets and databases. Placing the chapters in order does not make a lot of sense. 

In essence, each of our five tutorials should start with a get-the-data section which makes use of one of the later chapters. It then also covers the material in some of the middle chapters. The intro chapters are all covered in the first tutorial.

We don't cover any of the workflow chapters, or chapters 27-29.

### r4ds-1

data visualization
data transformations
data tidying
data import

### r4ds-2

spreadsheets
layers
exploratory data analysis
communication

### r4ds-3

databases (duck)
logical vectors
numbers
strings
regular expressions

### r4ds-4

arrow
factors
dates-times
missing values
joins

### r4ds-5

hierarchical-data
web-scraping
functions
iterations

### R4DS tutorial structure

The introduction and summary are like any AI tutorial: Github, GH Pages and so on.

There are 3 to 5 Sections, each begins with some data processing and/or manipulation, questions which cover the important packages and functions in the relevant chapters. 

### Data storage

Most R4DS tutorials require the use of some strange data structures, like arrow files, spreadsheets and what not. We want to maintain our own copies of those starter files, even though they originally come from the web somewhere. 

* These are stored in `inst/extdata`. 

* Document where these files come from in a brief note in `inst/extdata/README.txt`.

* The files should be much less than 100 megabytes each because we want students to be able to easily download them and back them up in their personal repos.

* We exclude `inst/extdata` from the R package. Which is OK! We need to keep the size of the package down if we want this to be on CRAN someday.
